# CSet-container
This is C++ implementation of data structure Set operating over linear linked list. It was implemented as a school project in a course Practical programming in C++(BPC-PPC), which is taught at The Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication, Brno University of Technology. The list is created from nodes of class CEntityBase, which I cannot disclose as I am not it's author. The project worked in a way that CEntityBase class created linear list nodes, which could carry implemented types, two of them which I am an author of are included in this repository they are CEntity_CDouble.h and CEntity_TPoint.h, in these files are defined classes for these two data types, which could be used through a namespace as a CEntity to constuct linear list and thus a CSet. With this CSet class, defined in files CSet.h and CSet.cpp, then could be executed methods which are in file main.cpp
